With every large Rails project, there is a need to bypass the normal ActiveRecord
API, and get closer to the low-level SQL API. Here are a few useful methods
for unlocking the confines.

### find_by_sql

```
users = User.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1")
```

This returns model instances for the given SQL string.

`find_by_sql` accepts parametrized values:

```ruby
users = User.find_by_sql(["SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1])
```

### select_all

```ruby
users = User.connection.select_all("
  SELECT first_name, created_at FROM users
   WHERE id = 1")
```

This returns an array-like object of type `ActiveRecord::Result`. Each item in
the collection is a `Hash` representing a row in the results.

The `ActiveRecord::Result` contains information about the table and its columns.
It knows how to convert column values to their corresponding Ruby types.

### execute

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1")
```

This returns an array-like object that is specific on the database driver. For
PostgreSQL, this will be a `PG::Result`. Item item in the collection is a
`Hash`. The values of the Hash are strings and nils. No conversion is performed
to convert the values to the appropriate Ruby type, other than NULL to nil.

### quote

The `select_all` and `execute` methods have no built-in mechanism for escaping
values for the SQL statement.

Something like this is bad practice:

```ruby
users = User.connection.select_all("
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='#{email}'")
```

Because we're not sure what is in `email`. It could have an SQL injection
attack, or it could just have characters that weren't expected. To cover these
cases, ActiveRecord provides `#quote`:

```
users = User.connection.select_all("
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='#{User.connection.quote(email)}'")
```

### sanitize_sql_array

Using `#quote` can get unwieldy as more and more values need to be escaped.
There is a private method called `#sanitize_sql_array` that brings back the
parameterized escape mechanism that is present in ActiveRecord's higher-level
API.

```ruby
sql = ActiveRecord::Base.send(:sanitize_sql_array,
  ["SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=?", email])
users = User.connection.select_all(sql)
```

### connection_config

Sometimes you need to introspect the database connection details. Maybe you have an external utility that performs bulk operations against the database, and
you need to bypass ActiveRecord entirely.

```ruby
config = ActiveRecord::Base.connection_config

{
  :adapter           => "postgres",
  :encoding          => "utf8",
  :postgis_extension => true,
  :username          => "user",
  :password          => nil,
  :host              => "127.0.0.1",
  :port              => 5432,
  :database          => "database_name"
}
```

The only problem is that the password is not there. It shows as `nil`.
