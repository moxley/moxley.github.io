Wordpress has been my blogging platform for the last two years, and
Drupal for a few years before that. Both are written in PHP and both
were installed and maintained on a traditional shared hosting account.
I would have stuck with Wordpress if it weren't for it's lack of robust
Markdown language support. Writing a coder's blog requires code samples,
usually in multiple languages. Github's flavor of Markdown has proved to be
an excellent language for authoring content that includes code samples, and
Octopress supports it by default.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
is a wrapper around [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and Jekyll is well suited for
publishing a blog to a Github's Pages service. Since Jekyll only generates a
static site, it can be much faster than a PHP solution like Wordpress or Drupal.
When used in conjunction with the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/),
Octopress becomes a powerful blogging platform.
