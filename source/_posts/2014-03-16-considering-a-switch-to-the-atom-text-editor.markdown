You've probably heard of [Atom, Github's new text editor](http://atom.io/). Read
these checklists to help you decide whether it's an editor worth switching to.

## General Pros

*   Open Source
*   High-quality extension and enhancement infrastructure
*   View is programmable using good old HTML DOM and CSS
*   Well-known API model (NodeJS)
*   Built-in Github integration
*   Built-in, light Git integration
*   [Realtime Markdown preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGUemwCaBR0&amp;feature=youtu.be)
*   Seamlessly tracks external file renames while the file is open
*   Browse archive files, like zip or tar.gz, like Emacs does.
*   UI and editing features basically a clone of Sublime Text
*   Free, while in Beta.

## General Cons

*   In Beta. Some rough UX details.
*   No keyboard macros
*   No command documentation
*   Difficult to discover available commands
*   Currently only works on OS X (Windows and Linux planned)

## For Sublime Users

### Pros

*   Package manager is built in
*   Deep customization API
*   Fine-grained commands
*   Complete pane splitting and pane navigation
*   Smarter indentation of pasted text

### Cons

*   2-3x slower, 2-3x more memory than ST3 (realistically, it's not as bad as it sounds)
*   No "Jump Back" feature, as found in ST3
*   No auto-highlighting matching strings of selected string
*   Can't open file in existing window, unless it lives within the window's directory
*   Missing key bindings for many search &amp; replace operations

## For Vim and Emacs Users

### Pros

*   Modern Application and UI, contemporary key bindings
*   Easy to learn
*   Built in Package manager, and standard package formats
*   View is good old HTML DOM, CSS
*   CoffeeScript is arguably better than eLisp and Vimscript
*   Editor API reaches deep into the editor
*   Project-wide fuzzy file finder, built in, fuss-free
*   Buffer-wide fuzzy symbol finder, built in, fuss-free
*   Project-wide string search
*   Large number of homerow-close key bindings (many of them are Emacs compatible)
*   Pane splitting on par with Vim and Emacs
*   Multi selections
*   Code Snippets

### Cons

*   Costs money
*   Core is closed-source for now
*   Editor API doesn't go as deep as Emacs. Lacks rich callback API that Emacs has.
*   No cursor history, so no command for going back to the last location without using bookmarks
*   No cursor navigation around, or editing operations on, symbol definitions (e.g., methods)
*   Unlike Emacs, no built-in shell console (package under development)
*   Keyboard navigation of file tree is cumbersome, but will likely improve over time.
*   Missing a lot of the cool text navigation and editing commands available to Vim and Emacs
