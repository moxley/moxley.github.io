      <description>Did you know that when using these applications:
 Any application on OS X, except Vim and MS products Bash, or any console program with Readline support  These key bindings are available:
 Control-A - Move to beginning of line Control-E - Move to end of line Control-F - Move forward one column Control-B - Move backward one column Control-N - Move to next line Control-P - Move to previous line Control-D - Delete next character Control-H - Delete previous character Control-K - Delete from cursor to end of line Control-Y - Paste what was deleted with Control-K  It seems silly, but the thing I love the most about OS X is the ubiquity of these key bindings.</description>
