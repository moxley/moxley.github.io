      <description>I have a deep interest in knowing exactly how a neural network works. Not only do I want to know the theory, I want to know&amp;ndash; in practice&amp;ndash; what&amp;rsquo;s happening to the neuron&amp;rsquo;s weights as the network is being trained.
With TensorFlow, it took a lot of work and investigation to finally get to a point where I had something that visualized weights being trained.
It seemed that TensorFlow was putting roadblocks at every possible path to getting the valuees of the changing weights.</description>

      <description>I was very excited to start running TensorFlow Python programs on my Mac.
I installed it using PIP, using the instructions provided by TensorFlow.org. On running my first TensorFlow program, the first thing it output was:
2018-11-25 19:13:07.524017: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA  This didn&amp;rsquo;t look good, it turned out it&amp;rsquo;s just a warning. My program worked, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t running as fast as it could.</description>
